# Gallery Store Manager

As a unpaid concert Photographer I need to find a way to store my images without too much pain. There is a bunch of Programms outthere, but none of those do everything I need in order to keep my Storage in the way I would like to have it. 


## First things to consider
- I have too many pictures (More than 500K), but I got to be able to delete duplicates based of many different things. The most important key too me at this moment is the Hash value. I have many pictures that might look alike, but they are still different and maybe I am going to need them. 

- I need to store my pictures in a way that to me makes enough sense when I want to look for a picture based of dates. 


## What is ready so far?
-I'm creating the project and drafting


## What do I need to test this project? 
-Linux (I have not tested it in Windows, Mac or any other thing)

-A C# working enviroment, which in my case is Monodevelop and Rider.
